                <p>Tiny Apartment is an artist in residence started by Quinlan Deer. Quinlan is an artist currently working as a web developer and designer. She studied art at the University of British Columbia. The residence takes place in the guest room of Quinlan's spare room on a quiet street in the middle of Montreal's cultural and creative neighbourhood, the Plateau. </p>
                <p>The idea of creating a residence in residence was born out of the inspiration from AIRs popping up all over the world in a variety of different forms and environments. Tiny apartment's purpose is to create community and collaboration through living in another artist's space.</p>
                <p>Residences will typically last one month, but the timeline is flexible depending on the artist's availability. At the end of the residence, an exhibition will be held inside and the apartment and it's surrounding areas. The residence will cover exhibition opening costs, and publicity. A small fee will be asked from the artist in residence for basic utilities. The artist is also expected to pay for their own materials.</p>
                <p>Tiny apartment accepts and will consider artists of all media. Artists working in installation and audiovisual art are especially encouraged to apply.  </p>
                <p><strong>FAQS</strong></p> 
                <p><em>What is the accomodation like? </em></p>
                <p>Artists will stay in the guest room/studio space of my apartment. There will be a futon, a desk space, a chair, a projector and two white walls to work on. Bathroom and kitchen are shared.</p>
                <p><em>How long are residences and when do they begin?</em></p>
                <p>Residences will typically be one month long, but this timeline is flexible to be shorter/longer depending on the artist's availability. There are no set dates on when residences begin/end. This is also dependant on my own schedule and the schedule of the participating artist.</p>
                 <p><em>Where will the exhibition be held and how long will it be on?</em></p>
                 <p>Exhibitions will be in "pop up" style. Meaning, they will only be on for one night. The pop-up exhibition will take place in and around the apartment. The furniture will be cleared out and the artist will be able to use the space (inside and out) as they see fit.</p>
                 <p><em>What kind of artists are accepted?</em></p>
                 <p>Visual artists, musicians, performing artists and writers are all accepted. The only catch is that there must me a visual element to whatever art form you choose to exhbit at the end of the month. Being a visual artist myself, I'm open to the idea of collaborating with artists whose practise does not include any visual element</p>
                 <p><em>Can more than one person take part in the residency at a time?</em></p>
                 <p>Yes! But they must be okay with sharing a sleeping surface and living space.</p>
